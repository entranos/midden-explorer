A key technical feature is the batch/cullet preheater, which uses residual heat from flue gases to warm the solid raw materials before they enter the melting furnace, significantly reducing the thermal energy required for melting.

This technology is specifically configured for tableware manufacturing facilities requiring high-quality molten glass output.\n\nThe process operates by consuming 3560 GJ of natural gas and 240 GJ of electricity (representing 10% electric boosting) to melt raw materials consisting of 0.5 kt of cullet (recycled glass) and 0.5 kt of batch minerals, achieving a 50% cullet rate. The system utilizes 0.284 kt of gaseous oxygen for oxy-fuel combustion, which produces higher flame temperatures and eliminates nitrogen from the combustion process. A key technical feature is the preheating of oxygen and the conversion of input natural gas into hot syngas, which enhances heat transfer efficiency within the furnace. The melting process generates 1 kt of molten glass as the primary product while exhausting 389 GJ of energy in flue gases.\n\nThe technology offers significant environmental and efficiency benefits through its advanced heat recovery system, which captures and reuses thermal energy that would otherwise be lost. The oxy-fuel combustion combined with syngas conversion substantially reduces flue gas volumes compared to air-fuel systems, leading to lower energy consumption per ton of glass produced and reduced carbon emissions. The high cullet incorporation rate (50%) further enhances sustainability by recycling glass waste and reducing the energy required for melting virgin materials.\n\nThis technology is particularly suited for high-quality tableware glass production in industrial settings where energy efficiency and environmental performance are priorities, including manufacturing of dinnerware, drinking glasses, and decorative glass items that require precise temperature control and consistent melt quality.",

    "detailed_description": "A post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) system for oxyfuel furnaces is designed to remove and compress carbon dioxide from industrial flue gas streams before atmospheric release. The system processes approximately 1.02 kilotonnes of CO2 from combustion exhaust, treating it through purification stages that eliminate particulates, contaminants, and water vapor, ultimately compressing the purified CO2 into a transportable, sealed form suitable for storage or utilization applications.\n\nThe technology operates by first capturing CO2-rich flue gas from oxyfuel combustion processes, where fuel burns in an oxygen-enriched environment rather than air, producing higher CO2 concentrations. The captured gas undergoes multi-stage treatment including filtration and dehydration to remove impurities that could compromise compression equipment or storage integrity. The system requires 2,750 GJ of natural gas to provide process heat for gas conditioning and regeneration of capture media, while 1,830 GJ of electricity powers compressors that pressurize the purified CO2 to approximately 100-150 bar, transforming it into a dense, supercritical or liquid state. This compression process accounts for the majority of the electrical demand, as the CO2 must reach sufficient pressure for pipeline transport or geological injection.\n\nThe primary output is approximately 1 kilotonne of compressed CO2, representing roughly 98% recovery of the input stream, with minor losses occurring during purification stages. From an environmental perspective, this technology prevents nearly all processed CO2 from entering the atmosphere, offering carbon capture rates exceeding 90% compared to unabated industrial processes. The energy penalty—the additional energy required for capture and compression—is partially offset by the high-purity CO2 stream produced in oxyfuel systems, which requires less separation work than traditional post-combustion capture from air-fired furnaces.\n\nTypical industrial applications include cement manufacturing, steel production, glass melting, and large-scale power generation facilities where oxyfuel combustion can be integrated with existing furnace infrastructure. Industries with high-temperature process requirements particularly benefit from this approach, as the oxyfuel configuration enables both efficient combustion and concentrated CO2 production suitable for capture.",

The purpose is to shape, strengthen, and finish molten glass into high-quality tableware items suitable for commercial sale.\n\nThe process operates with a specific energy split of 65% natural gas and 35% electricity within the post-melting stages. The natural gas (1090 GJ) primarily fuels the annealing lehrs that slowly cool the formed glass to relieve internal stresses and prevent cracking, while electricity (584 GJ) powers forming equipment, surface treatment systems, and inspection machinery.

    "detailed_description": "A sinter plant is a pre-processing facility that agglomerates fine iron ore particles into a porous, clinker-like material called sinter, which serves as the primary feedstock for blast furnaces in steelmaking. The technology addresses the challenge that fine iron ore particles cannot be directly charged into blast furnaces due to poor gas permeability and tendency to be blown out with exhaust gases. By converting these fines into larger, more permeable pieces, sinter plants enable efficient blast furnace operation while utilizing lower-cost fine ore materials.\n\nThe sintering process works by mixing iron ore fines (0.8 Mt) with calcium carbonate (0.18 Mt) as a flux and a small amount of coke (0.04 Mt) as fuel. This mixture is spread onto a moving grate where ignition occurs at the surface, and combustion progresses downward through the bed. Natural gas (0.04 PJ) assists in the ignition process, while electricity (0.124 PJ) powers the ventilation fans that draw air through the bed, sustaining combustion and fusing the particles together. The process produces approximately 1 Mt of sinter from 0.8 Mt of iron ore input, with the mass increase due to the incorporation of flux materials.\n\nSinter plants provide significant efficiency benefits by enabling the use of fine iron ore that would otherwise require pelletizing or be unsuitable for blast furnaces. The technology reduces overall energy consumption in steelmaking by pre-reducing some iron oxides and incorporating flux materials before the blast furnace stage, thereby lowering coke requirements downstream. Additionally, sinter's porous structure improves gas flow in blast furnaces, enhancing reduction efficiency and productivity. This technology is standard in integrated steel mills worldwide, particularly those using blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace routes, and is essential for modern iron and steel production where fine ore concentrates dominate the raw material supply.",

The pelletization process improves the permeability and reducibility of iron ore in subsequent steelmaking operations, making it more efficient than using raw fine ore directly. This technology serves as a critical intermediate step in the iron and steel production chain, converting low-grade or fine iron ore materials into a premium feedstock.\n\nThe process begins with 1.08 Mt of iron ore being ground, mixed with small quantities of binding agents (olivine at 0.0231 kt and calcium carbonate at 0.0147 kt), and formed into green pellets through agglomeration. These pellets are then hardened through high-temperature treatment using multiple energy sources: BOFG (Blast Furnace Off-Gas) at 0.231 PJ provides the primary thermal energy, supplemented by natural gas at 0.00839 PJ and a minimal amount of coke (0.00839 Mt) as fuel.

The mixture is then formed into green pellets through rolling drum or disc pelletizers, which agglomerate the fine particles into spheres typically 9-16mm in diameter.

    "detailed_description": "Top Gas Recycling Blast Furnace with Carbon Capture and Storage (TGR-BF + CCS) is an advanced ironmaking technology that produces pig iron while significantly reducing CO2 emissions through integrated carbon capture. This system enhances the traditional blast furnace process by recycling and treating the top gas—the exhaust gases that normally exit the furnace—and capturing carbon dioxide using a Vacuum Pressure Swing Adsorption (VPSA) unit before it reaches the atmosphere.\n\nThe process operates by feeding iron ore pellets (0.792 Mt) and sinter (0.792 Mt) along with coke (0.187 Mt) into the blast furnace, where oxygen gas (266 kt) supports combustion and reduction reactions. Coal (5.15 PJ) and coke oven gas or COG (0.29 PJ) provide additional energy and reducing agents, while electricity (0.301 PJ) powers auxiliary equipment including the VPSA unit and gas compression systems. The top gas recycling loop enriches the blast with CO and reduces the overall fuel requirements, while the VPSA unit selectively separates CO2 from the recycled gas stream based on differential adsorption under varying pressures. For every million tonnes of pig iron produced, the system generates 0.26 Mt of slag as a byproduct, 0.7 PJ of tail gas for potential energy recovery, and captures 0.786 Mt of compressed CO2 ready for storage or utilization.\n\nThe primary environmental benefit of this technology is the substantial reduction in direct CO2 emissions compared to conventional blast furnaces, with captured carbon representing approximately 60-70% of the process emissions that would otherwise be released. The top gas recycling also improves thermal efficiency by recovering sensible heat and chemical energy from the exhaust gases. This technology is particularly suited for large-scale steel mills seeking to decarbonize their operations while maintaining high productivity, and it represents a bridge technology for the steel industry's transition toward carbon neutrality in regions with established blast furnace infrastructure and access to CO2 storage facilities.",

During the high-temperature carbonization process, volatile compounds are driven off from the coal, leaving behind a porous, carbon-rich solid structure. The facility produces 1 Mt of coke as its primary output, while simultaneously generating valuable byproducts including 7.23 PJ of coke oven gas (which can be recycled or used elsewhere), 35.9 kt of coal tar, 11.8 kt of BTX aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylene), and 1.5 PJ of medium-pressure steam.\n\nThe TGR+CCS configuration offers significant environmental benefits by capturing CO2 emissions that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere and recycling combustion gases to improve thermal efficiency. The net positive production of COG and steam (producing more than consumed) demonstrates the energy recovery efficiency of the system, reducing the overall energy intensity per unit of coke produced.

The highly exothermic nature of the reaction generates significant heat, which is recovered as 2010 GJ of medium-pressure steam, representing a substantial energy credit that exceeds the steam input by more than tenfold. This heat recovery transforms the process into a net energy producer in terms of steam generation.\n\nThe primary output is 1 kt of EDC_oxy, a gaseous mixture of EDC and water vapor that requires downstream separation and purification. The technology offers significant environmental benefits through its energy efficiency, as the substantial steam generation (2010 GJ output versus 190 GJ input) can be integrated into broader chemical plant steam networks, reducing overall fossil fuel consumption. The oxychlorination route is particularly valuable in chlor-alkali complexes where it enables the balanced consumption of chlorine and hydrogen chloride, minimizing waste hydrochloric acid disposal issues while maximizing atom economy in the vinyl chloride monomer production chain.",

The system combines multiple distillation columns into an integrated purification block that processes EDC streams from different sources to achieve the required product specifications for downstream chemical synthesis.\n\nThe technology operates by accepting EDC from three distinct sources: direct chlorination (EDC_DC at 0.19 kt), oxychlorination (EDC_oxy at 0.34 kt), and recycled material (EDC_recycle at 0.5 kt), totaling approximately 1.02 kt of feed material.

The electricity is primarily used to power compressors, pumps, and process control systems throughout the production facility.\n\nFrom an efficiency standpoint, modern nitric acid plants can achieve high conversion rates of ammonia to nitric acid, typically exceeding 95%. The process generates significant heat that can be recovered through heat exchangers and used elsewhere in the plant or for generating steam, improving overall energy efficiency. However, nitrous oxide (N₂O), a potent greenhouse gas, is produced as a byproduct, which modern plants increasingly capture and abate to minimize environmental impact.\n\nNitric acid finds widespread application in the fertilizer industry, where it is used to produce ammonium nitrate and calcium ammonium nitrate, accounting for approximately 80% of global production. Other significant applications include the production of adipic acid for nylon manufacturing, explosives production for mining and construction, and metal processing applications such as pickling and etching.",

    "detailed_description": "Urea production is a chemical synthesis process that combines ammonia and carbon dioxide under high-pressure conditions to manufacture urea, a nitrogen-rich compound primarily used as a fertilizer and in various industrial applications. The process leverages the exothermic reaction between these two feedstocks to create an efficient pathway for nitrogen fixation in a stable, transportable form.\n\nThe synthesis occurs in two main stages within the reactor system. First, ammonia (0.57 kt) and carbon dioxide (0.73 kt) react at elevated pressures, typically 140-250 bar, to form ammonium carbamate as an intermediate compound. This intermediate is then dehydrated using medium-pressure steam (2.2 TJ at 10-19 bar) as a heat source, driving off water molecules and converting the carbamate into urea. Electricity (0.3 TJ) powers pumps, compressors, and control systems necessary to maintain the high-pressure environment and circulate reactants through the synthesis loop. The process yields 1 kt of urea as the primary output product.\n\nThis technology offers significant environmental benefits by utilizing carbon dioxide as a feedstock rather than releasing it as waste, effectively capturing and converting approximately 0.73 kt of CO2 per kiloton of urea produced. The process is relatively energy-efficient compared to alternative nitrogen compound synthesis routes, with the exothermic nature of the initial carbamate formation offsetting some of the energy requirements for the subsequent dehydration step.\n\nUrea production facilities are essential in the agricultural sector, where urea serves as the world's most widely used solid nitrogen fertilizer due to its high nitrogen content (46% by weight). Industrial applications include its use as a raw material in the production of urea-formaldehyde resins, melamine plastics, animal feed supplements, and diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) for selective catalytic reduction systems in vehicles.",

This technology combines water electrolysis powered by electricity with the traditional Haber-Bosch synthesis process to produce ammonia without direct combustion of natural gas or coal.\n\nThe process works by using electrical energy (40.2 TJ) to electrolyze water, splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen gases. The hydrogen generated from this electrolysis is then combined with nitrogen (typically extracted from air through established air separation methods that also run on electricity) in a Haber-Bosch reactor under high temperature and pressure conditions, facilitated by catalysts, to form ammonia (NH3). This configuration produces approximately 1 kiloton of ammonia output from the specified electrical input.\n\nThe primary environmental benefit of electrolytic ammonia production lies in its potential to dramatically reduce carbon emissions when the electricity source comes from renewable energy such as wind, solar, or hydropower, eliminating the substantial CO2 footprint associated with conventional steam methane reforming processes. The efficiency of this approach depends heavily on the electricity source and the overall electrical-to-chemical energy conversion rate, which continues to improve with advancing electrolyzer and catalyst technologies.\n\nTypical industrial applications include fertilizer production for agriculture, which consumes the majority of global ammonia output, as well as manufacturing of industrial chemicals, refrigeration systems, and increasingly as a carbon-free energy carrier and fuel for maritime shipping and power generation in the emerging hydrogen economy.",

    "detailed_description": "Ammonia production using imported hydrogen is a modified approach to the traditional Haber-Bosch process that relies on externally sourced hydrogen rather than producing it on-site from natural gas or other feedstocks. The primary purpose of this technology is to synthesize ammonia (NH3) by combining imported hydrogen gas with atmospheric nitrogen under controlled conditions of high temperature and pressure, utilizing the well-established catalytic Haber-Bosch synthesis method.\n\nThe process requires 21.4 TJ of hydrogen gas as the primary feedstock and 6.2 TJ of electricity to power the synthesis operations. The electricity drives compressors that maintain the high pressures (150-300 bar) required for the Haber-Bosch reaction, operates pumps and control systems, and supports ancillary equipment throughout the facility. The imported hydrogen reacts with nitrogen extracted from air through an air separation unit over an iron-based catalyst at temperatures of 400-500°C, forming ammonia through the exothermic reaction N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3. For the specified input levels, the process produces approximately 1 kiloton of ammonia as its main output.\n\nThis approach offers significant environmental benefits when the imported hydrogen is produced from renewable energy sources (green hydrogen), as it eliminates the carbon-intensive steam methane reforming process traditionally used for hydrogen generation in conventional ammonia plants. By decoupling hydrogen production from ammonia synthesis, facilities can achieve near-zero direct CO2 emissions while maintaining high production efficiency. The technology is particularly valuable in industries requiring ammonia for fertilizer production, chemical manufacturing, and emerging applications in energy storage and carbon-free fuel systems, especially in regions with limited access to natural gas but availability of clean hydrogen supply chains.",

The process begins with zinc concentrate and zinc oxides containing zinc metal, which undergoes sequential treatment to ultimately yield ultra-pure zinc suitable for premium applications.\n\nThe process operates through three distinct technical stages. First, the roasting stage uses thermal energy from natural gas and gasoil to convert zinc sulfide concentrates and zinc oxides into zinc oxide while driving off sulfur as sulfur dioxide. In the leaching stage, the calcined zinc oxide is dissolved in dilute sulfuric acid to produce a zinc sulfate solution, with careful purification steps to remove impurities like iron, cadmium, and other trace metals.

The technology employs a gas-fired boiler connected to a steam turbine, designed specifically to meet the substantial thermal and electrical energy demands of sugar refining and processing operations. This integrated approach contrasts with separate generation of heat and power, which would require more fuel and generate more emissions for the same useful energy output.\n\nThe system operates by combusting 0.043 PJ of natural gas in a boiler to produce high-pressure steam. This steam is then expanded through a steam turbine, which extracts mechanical energy to drive an electrical generator producing 0.006 PJ of electricity. The exhaust steam leaving the turbine is maintained at low pressure (1-9 bar) and delivers 0.0315 PJ of thermal energy, which is ideal for the various heating processes required in sugar manufacturing, such as juice evaporation, crystallization, and drying operations.\n\nThe primary environmental benefit of this CHP configuration is its superior energy efficiency compared to separate heat and power generation, achieving combined efficiencies typically between 75-85% by utilizing both the electrical and thermal outputs. By recovering the thermal energy that would otherwise be wasted in conventional power generation, the system reduces overall natural gas consumption and associated carbon dioxide emissions per unit of useful energy delivered. This efficiency translates directly into lower operating costs and a reduced carbon footprint for sugar production facilities.\n\nCHP systems for sugar production are commonly deployed in beet sugar refineries and cane sugar mills where consistent, substantial demands for both process steam and electrical power exist.

Calcium oxide (lime) plays a crucial role in the purification stage, where it reacts with impurities in the raw juice to form precipitates that can be removed, producing betacal as a byproduct. The clarified juice then undergoes multi-stage evaporation using low-pressure steam (1-9 bar, consuming 2.94 TJ) to concentrate the sugar content, followed by crystallization where pure white sugar crystals form and are separated from the remaining molasses. Electricity (0.573 TJ) powers the mechanical equipment including choppers, pumps, centrifuges, and conveyors throughout the facility.\n\nFrom 7.14 kt of sugar beets, the process yields 1 kt of white sugar as the main product, along with 0.286 kt of molasses (a thick syrup used in animal feed and fermentation), 0.429 kt of betacal (a lime-rich material suitable as soil amendment), 1.43 kt of wet beet pulp (animal feed), and 4.29 kt of beet tops and ends.

As the heated medium contacts the pulp, moisture evaporates from the biomass and is carried away by exhaust gases. The technology processes 3.46 kilotons of wet beet pulp (at 28% dry matter content) using 6.08 terajoules of natural gas energy, employing either rotary drum dryers, belt dryers, or flash dryers depending on the specific installation and capacity requirements.\n\nFrom an efficiency perspective, drying beet pulp provides substantial environmental and economic benefits by converting a bulky, high-moisture waste product into a valuable commodity with reduced weight and volume for transportation. The dried pulp typically achieves 88-92% dry matter content, representing a significant mass reduction that lowers logistics costs and carbon emissions associated with transport. Additionally, the dried product prevents spoilage and methane emissions that would otherwise occur from decomposing wet pulp.\n\nThis technology is predominantly employed in sugar beet processing facilities where large quantities of wet pulp are generated as a byproduct during sugar extraction.

    "detailed_description": "A steam turbine is a mechanical device that converts thermal energy from pressurized steam into rotational mechanical energy, which is then used to drive an electrical generator for power production. This technology serves as a critical component in power generation systems, enabling the conversion of steam energy—typically generated from boilers—into usable electricity for industrial facilities or electrical grids.\n\nThe turbine operates by directing medium-pressure steam (10-19 bar) through a series of stationary nozzles and rotating blades mounted on a shaft. As the steam expands and flows through the turbine stages, it imparts kinetic energy to the blades, causing the rotor to spin at high speeds. This rotational energy is transmitted to a coupled generator that converts the mechanical work into electrical energy. In this specific configuration, the turbine accepts 0.075 PJ of medium-pressure steam as input and produces 0.0315 PJ of electricity as output, representing an energy conversion efficiency of approximately 42%.\n\nSteam turbines offer significant efficiency benefits by extracting maximum useful work from steam before it is exhausted or condensed, making them essential for cogeneration systems where waste heat recovery is prioritized. The ability to utilize medium-pressure steam makes this technology particularly valuable for industrial applications where steam is already available from process heating or boiler operations. This approach reduces overall fuel consumption and carbon emissions compared to generating electricity separately from fossil fuels.\n\nTypical industrial applications include chemical plants, refineries, pulp and paper mills, and district heating facilities where both steam and electricity demands exist simultaneously. These combined heat and power (CHP) installations maximize overall system efficiency by cascading energy through multiple uses, with the steam turbine serving as the intermediary step between high-grade thermal energy and electrical power generation.",

This intense heat causes methane molecules (CH₄) to undergo pyrolysis, splitting into solid carbon and gaseous hydrogen through a direct, single-step thermochemical process.\n\nThe process requires 53.2 GJ of natural gas as the primary feedstock and 15.4 GJ of electricity to sustain the plasma state and maintain reaction conditions. The electrical input powers electrodes or electromagnetic fields that generate and stabilize the plasma, while the methane molecules passing through this plasma zone rapidly decompose. For every tonne of fluffy carbon black produced, the system also generates 0.334 tonnes of hydrogen gas as a valuable co-product, representing a stoichiometrically favorable yield based on the molecular composition of methane.\n\nThis technology offers significant environmental benefits by avoiding CO₂ emissions that would otherwise result from conventional carbon black production or hydrogen generation through steam methane reforming.

The steam provides the thermal energy necessary for controlling viscosity, promoting efficient separation, and facilitating enzymatic or chemical treatments that may be applied to the starch stream. Electricity powers the various pumps, centrifuges, dryers, and conveyors throughout the facility.

    "detailed_description": "Whey powder evaporation using a 6-effect evaporator with Thermal Vapor Recompression (TVR) is an industrial concentration process designed to remove water from liquid whey before final drying. This technology serves as a critical intermediate step in dairy processing, reducing the moisture content of prepared whey from approximately 93-95% water down to 40-50% solids, making subsequent spray drying more energy-efficient and economical.\n\nThe system operates through a 6-effect evaporation cascade, where whey passes through six sequential evaporation chambers, each operating at progressively lower pressures and temperatures. The TVR component enhances efficiency by using medium-pressure steam (10-19 bar) in an ejector to compress low-pressure vapor from the later evaporation effects, recycling this thermal energy back into the process. The technology processes 2.78 kilotons of prepared whey using 0.45 TJ of medium-pressure steam and 0.137 TJ of electricity to drive pumps, controls, and ancillary equipment. This results in 1 kiloton of concentrated evaporated whey as the primary product while removing 1.78 kilotons of moisture as vapor.\n\nThe environmental benefits of this 6-effect system with TVR are substantial compared to single-effect evaporation, achieving energy savings of 80-85% through vapor reuse and the cascading effect design. By concentrating whey before spray drying, the overall energy consumption of whey powder production is dramatically reduced, as removing water through evaporation requires significantly less energy than thermal drying.\n\nThis technology finds widespread application in dairy processing facilities that produce whey protein concentrate, whey powder ingredients for food manufacturing, infant formula production, and nutritional supplements. It is particularly valuable in cheese manufacturing plants where large volumes of liquid whey byproduct must be efficiently converted into marketable whey powder products.",

This technology combines a spray dryer that atomizes the evaporated whey into fine droplets, a fluid-bed dryer for secondary drying and cooling, packaging equipment for product handling, and integrated cleaning systems to maintain hygiene standards in dairy processing facilities.\n\nThe process begins with evaporated whey (1.94 kilotons) being fed into the spray dryer, where it is atomized into a fine mist and exposed to hot air created using medium-pressure steam (4.82 TJ at 10-19 bar). The rapid evaporation of moisture from the droplets produces primary whey powder particles. These particles then pass through a fluid-bed dryer for final moisture removal and cooling, achieving the desired powder characteristics of low moisture content, controlled particle size, and improved flowability. The system requires electricity (0.367 TJ) to power pumps, atomizers, conveyors, and packaging machinery. Hot water (1.31 TJ at 60-100°C) is utilized in the CIP system to clean equipment surfaces, piping, and spray nozzles between production runs, ensuring food safety compliance without manual disassembly.\n\nThis technology offers significant environmental benefits by converting a dairy by-product into a valuable commodity, reducing waste disposal needs and extending product shelf life from days to months without refrigeration.

The technology employs centrifugal separators to extract cream from milk, followed by controlled churning in specialized tanks to phase-invert the fat globules, and concludes with packaging systems to prepare the final product for distribution.\n\nThe process begins with 17.9 kilotonnes of whole milk fed into centrifugal separators powered by electricity (0.706 TJ), which exploit density differences to separate the fat-rich cream from skimmed milk. The cream then undergoes pasteurization using low-pressure steam (1.22 TJ at 1-9 bar) and temperature conditioning with warm water (0.341 TJ at 60-100°C) through heat exchangers to achieve optimal churning conditions. In the butter churns, mechanical agitation causes fat globules to coalesce and undergo phase inversion, where the emulsion transforms from fat-in-water to water-in-fat, forming butter grains that are subsequently worked into a continuous mass. Water pumps circulate the heated water for temperature control throughout the process, while butter tanks provide holding and working stations before automated packaging machines prepare the final product.\n\nThe process yields 1 kilotonne of butter as the primary output, while simultaneously producing 15.9 kilotonnes of skimmed milk and 1.01 kilotonnes of buttermilk as valuable co-products rather than waste streams. This efficient utilization of all milk components provides environmental benefits by minimizing waste and maximizing resource recovery, as both skimmed milk and buttermilk can be sold for human consumption or further processing into other dairy products.

The process creates a protein-rich retentate stream that serves as the primary product for subsequent powder production, while generating cream and permeate as co-products. This technology forms a critical upstream step in manufacturing high-protein dairy ingredients used across the food industry.\n\nThe process operates through three integrated technical stages utilizing centrifugal separation, thermal treatment, and membrane filtration. Initially, milk (4.71 kt) enters a centrifugal separator that removes fat, yielding cream (0.137 kt) as a valuable co-product. The separated milk then passes through heat exchangers powered by low-pressure steam (0.343 TJ at 1-9 bar), which pasteurizes the product and optimizes temperature conditions for membrane performance. Finally, ultrafiltration membranes, driven by electricity (0.239 TJ) to power pumps and control systems, selectively retain proteins and larger molecules while allowing water, lactose, and minerals to pass through as permeate (3.57 kt). The concentrated protein stream, or retentate (1 kt), contains approximately 4-5 times the protein concentration of the original milk.\n\nThis technology offers significant environmental and efficiency advantages compared to traditional evaporation-based concentration methods. Membrane filtration operates at relatively low temperatures, reducing thermal energy requirements and minimizing protein denaturation. The process recovers approximately 76% of the input milk mass as permeate, which retains valuable lactose and minerals that can be further processed into additional revenue-generating products rather than becoming waste streams.\n\nIndustrial applications span protein ingredient manufacturing for nutritional supplements, infant formula production, sports nutrition products, and high-protein food formulations.

    "detailed_description": "This technology represents an advanced milk powder production process that combines reverse osmosis (RO) preconcentration with mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) evaporation to create concentrated milk prior to spray drying. The system replaces traditional multi-effect evaporators with thermal vapor recompression (TVR) with a more energy-efficient single-effect MVR evaporator, preceded by a reverse osmosis filtration stage that removes water at lower energy cost than thermal evaporation.\n\nThe process begins with reverse osmosis, where prepared milk (3.73 kt input) is pushed through semipermeable membranes that separate water from milk solids without phase change or heat application. This preconcentration step removes a significant portion of water before the milk enters the MVR evaporator. The MVR evaporator then mechanically compresses water vapor using electrically-driven compressors (consuming 0.21 TJ of electricity), raising its temperature and pressure so it can be reused as heating medium within the same evaporator. A small amount of supplemental medium-pressure steam (0.157 TJ) is required only for startup and to compensate for minor heat losses, rather than providing continuous heating as in conventional systems.\n\nThe process outputs 1 kt of evaporated milk concentrate suitable for subsequent spray drying into milk powder, while removing 2.73 kt of moisture as separated water and vapor. This configuration achieves substantial energy savings compared to traditional 6-effect evaporators because the MVR system recycles thermal energy that would otherwise be lost, and the RO preconcentration removes water without requiring phase change energy. The reduced steam consumption (up to 80% less than conventional systems) translates to lower fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions at the facility level.\n\nThis technology is typically employed in large-scale dairy processing facilities producing whole milk powder, skim milk powder, and other concentrated dairy ingredients where high throughput and energy efficiency are economic priorities. The combination of RO and MVR is particularly advantageous in regions with high energy costs or strict environmental regulations on energy consumption and emissions.",

This system integrates spray drying equipment, fluid-bed dryers, and packaging machinery with an innovative zeolite absorption wheel that recovers thermal energy from exhaust air streams. The primary purpose is to remove moisture from evaporated whey retentate while preserving the nutritional and functional properties of whey proteins, producing a high-quality powder suitable for food and nutritional applications.\n\nThe process operates by atomizing 1.73 kilotons of evaporated whey retentate into fine droplets within a spray dryer chamber, where medium-pressure steam (10-19 bar) delivering 2.67 TJ of thermal energy rapidly evaporates the water content.

    "detailed_description": "The ICE condensing vacuum system is an advanced deodorization technology used in soybean oil refining that replaces conventional steam-jet ejector systems with a dry condensing vacuum pump. During the deodorization process, which is the final stage of edible oil refining, this system removes volatile compounds, free fatty acids, and odor-causing substances from crude soybean oil to produce high-quality refined oil suitable for human consumption. The technology creates and maintains the deep vacuum conditions (typically 1-5 mbar) required for effective deodorization at elevated temperatures, allowing unwanted volatile components to be stripped from the oil.\n\nThe process operates by feeding 1.02 kilotons of crude soybean oil into the deodorization unit, where it requires 104 GJ of medium-pressure steam (10-19 bar) for heating and stripping, along with 33 GJ of electricity to power the vacuum pump system. The dry condensing vacuum pump mechanically compresses vapors removed from the oil and condenses them without direct steam contact, unlike conventional steam-jet ejectors that mix steam with process vapors. This results in 1 kiloton of refined soybean oil as the primary product, with approximately 0.017 kilotons lost during processing due to the removal of impurities and some oil carried away with volatile compounds.\n\nThe ICE system offers significant environmental and efficiency benefits compared to traditional deodorization methods. By eliminating the need for large amounts of barometric condensing water and reducing steam consumption by up to 30-50%, the technology substantially decreases both water usage and energy requirements. The system also produces less wastewater that would otherwise require treatment, and the condensed byproducts can be more easily recovered and potentially valorized due to reduced dilution.\n\nThis technology finds typical applications in large-scale vegetable oil refineries processing soybean, canola, sunflower, and other edible oils where deodorization is essential for producing bland, shelf-stable products. It is particularly valuable in regions facing water scarcity or stringent environmental regulations, and in facilities seeking to modernize their operations for improved energy efficiency and reduced operating costs while maintaining or improving oil quality standards.",

This technology operates during the final refining stage to remove unwanted odors, flavors, and volatile compounds from refined palm oil while maintaining product quality. The system creates the necessary vacuum conditions for deodorization through a mechanical pumping process rather than relying on high-pressure steam ejectors, fundamentally changing how the vacuum environment is achieved and maintained.\n\nThe process takes refined palm oil as feedstock and utilizes medium-pressure steam (10-19 bar) at 150 GJ and electricity at 40 GJ to operate the deodorization equipment and vacuum system. The ICE condensing vacuum pump mechanically generates and maintains the required vacuum levels while internal condensing elements capture and condense vapors released during deodorization. This eliminates the need for external barometric condensers and significantly reduces water consumption. The technology processes 1 kiloton of refined palm oil to produce 1 kiloton of modified (deodorized) palm oil with improved sensory characteristics suitable for food applications.\n\nThe primary environmental benefit of ICE palm technology is its substantial reduction in steam consumption compared to conventional steam jet ejector systems, which can require 2-3 times more steam to achieve similar vacuum levels. The dry vacuum system also eliminates the large quantities of cooling water typically needed for barometric condensers, reducing both water consumption and wastewater generation. Additionally, the more efficient energy profile translates to lower greenhouse gas emissions per ton of processed oil.\n\nThis technology is particularly applicable in palm oil refineries, vegetable oil processing plants, and integrated oleochemical facilities where deodorization is a critical quality control step.

    "detailed_description": "Dry milling and fermentation is a bioethanol production process that converts corn into fuel-grade ethanol and valuable co-products. This technology serves as a key pathway for producing renewable biofuels from grain feedstocks, offering an alternative to petroleum-based transportation fuels while utilizing agricultural commodities.\n\nThe process begins with dry milling, where whole corn kernels are ground into flour without prior separation of their components. This corn flour is then mixed with water and enzymes to break down starches into fermentable sugars through a process called liquefaction and saccharification. Yeast is added to ferment these sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide over 48-72 hours. Following fermentation, the mixture undergoes distillation and dehydration to separate and purify the ethanol to fuel-grade specifications (typically 99%+ purity). The process requires 3 kt of corn as feedstock, along with 6.6 TJ of low-pressure steam for heating and distillation, 1.58 TJ of electricity for milling and pumping operations, and 3.96 TJ of natural gas primarily for steam generation and drying operations.\n\nThe technology produces approximately 1 kt of ethanol from 3 kt of corn input, representing roughly a 1:3 mass conversion ratio. A significant co-product is DDGS (Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles) at 0.95 kt, which contains concentrated proteins, fiber, and nutrients from the original corn. This co-product is highly valued as livestock feed, particularly for cattle and poultry, helping to improve the overall economics and sustainability of the process.\n\nFrom an environmental perspective, bioethanol from dry milling offers greenhouse gas emission reductions compared to gasoline, as the carbon released during combustion was recently captured from the atmosphere by the growing corn. The process is widely applied in the corn-belt regions of North America for producing fuel ethanol that is blended with gasoline (typically E10 or E15 blends), supporting renewable fuel standards and reducing dependence on fossil fuels in the transportation sector.",

This reaction simultaneously produces propylene oxide (0.45 kt) while converting ethylbenzene hydroperoxide to methylphenylcarbinol, which is subsequently dehydrated using hydrogen gas (0.00417 kt) to yield styrene monomer (1 kt). The process requires significant thermal energy input through high-pressure steam (5.89 TJ at 20-50 bar) for distillation and separation operations, along with electrical energy (0.6 TJ) for pumping and control systems. A valuable byproduct is residual fuel (2.97 TJ), which can be recovered for energy integration within the facility.\n\nThe environmental benefits of this technology stem primarily from the use of low-carbon propylene feedstock, which reduces the overall carbon footprint compared to conventional propylene sources derived from steam cracking of petroleum. The co-production approach itself improves efficiency by eliminating the need for separate oxidizing agents typically required in standalone propylene oxide production, reducing waste generation and energy consumption per unit of product.\n\nThis technology finds applications in industries requiring both styrene monomer and propylene oxide, particularly in chemical complexes producing polyurethane foams (from PO) and polystyrene plastics (from SM). The integrated nature makes it especially suitable for large-scale petrochemical facilities seeking to optimize capital investment and operational efficiency while meeting sustainability targets through the adoption of alternative, lower-carbon feedstock routes.",

This technology provides an energy-efficient alternative to primary aluminium production by remelting and reforming existing aluminium materials rather than extracting and refining new aluminium from bauxite ore.\n\nThe process begins by feeding both clean aluminium scrap (600 kg) and contaminated aluminium scrap (150 kg) into a melting furnace, along with primary aluminium ingots (250 kg) and aluminium alloys (12.5 kg) to achieve the desired metallurgical specifications. Natural gas (6.33 GJ) provides the primary heating energy to melt the charge, while electricity (0.576 GJ) powers auxiliary equipment such as pumps, conveyors, and control systems. The molten aluminium is refined to remove impurities from the contaminated scrap, then cast into standardized shapes like billets for extrusion processes or slabs for rolling operations.\n\nThis recycling technology delivers significant environmental benefits by consuming only about 5% of the energy required for primary aluminium production from bauxite, substantially reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs. The ability to incorporate contaminated scrap expands the available feedstock beyond premium clean scrap, improving overall material recovery rates from the waste stream.\n\nSecondary aluminium recycling finds widespread application across industries including automotive manufacturing (engine blocks, wheels, structural components), construction (window frames, curtain walls), packaging (beverage cans, foil), and aerospace (non-critical structural elements), where recycled aluminium can meet performance specifications while reducing material costs and environmental impact.",

    "detailed_description": "Green gas-fired furnaces in aluminium recycling plants represent a direct substitution technology that replaces conventional natural gas burners with systems capable of combusting renewable gas sources such as biomethane or synthetic methane produced from renewable hydrogen and captured CO2. The fundamental purpose is to maintain the same melting and refining capabilities of traditional aluminium recycling operations while dramatically reducing the carbon footprint associated with the thermal energy required for metal processing.\n\nThe furnace operates by melting and refining a mixed feedstock consisting of 600 kg of clean aluminium scrap, 150 kg of contaminated aluminium scrap, 250 kg of primary aluminium ingots, and 12.5 kg of aluminium alloys. The thermal energy for melting is provided by 6.33 GJ of green gas, while 0.576 GJ of electricity powers auxiliary systems such as material handling, control systems, and emissions management equipment. The combustion characteristics of green gas closely match those of natural gas, allowing for similar flame temperatures and heat transfer rates necessary to reach aluminium's melting point of approximately 660°C and maintain the molten metal at processing temperatures.\n\nThe primary environmental benefit stems from the carbon-neutral or carbon-negative nature of green gas compared to fossil natural gas, potentially reducing direct CO2 emissions by 80-100% depending on the green gas production pathway. Since the furnace technology and operational parameters remain largely unchanged from natural gas systems, energy efficiency is maintained at comparable levels while achieving substantial decarbonization. This technology is particularly applicable in secondary aluminium production facilities, automotive component manufacturing recycling operations, and packaging industry recycling plants where significant quantities of aluminium scrap must be continuously processed into usable alloy products.",

The manufacturing requires significant thermal energy input in the form of medium-pressure steam (10-19 bar) at 4.4 GJ per tonne, which is used for drying the wet paper sheets and maintaining proper moisture content throughout the corrugating process. Additionally, 1 GJ of electricity powers the mechanical equipment including the corrugating rolls that create the characteristic wavy flute pattern, the machinery that bonds the layers together, and the cutting and finishing equipment.\n\nFor every tonne of recovered paper input combined with the specified energy inputs, the process yields one tonne of finished corrugated board as output. This represents an efficient mass conversion where material losses are minimal, demonstrating the effectiveness of modern corrugated board manufacturing. The environmental benefits of this technology are substantial, as it diverts waste paper from landfills, reduces the need for virgin fiber pulp production, and creates a fully recyclable end product that can re-enter the paper recovery cycle multiple times.\n\nCorrugated board produced through this process finds widespread application across numerous industries, including e-commerce shipping boxes, food and beverage packaging, retail display materials, and protective packaging for fragile goods during transportation.

    "detailed_description": "A Backup Natural Gas Boiler is a steam generation system designed to provide high-pressure steam when primary steam sources are unavailable or insufficient. In this specific application, it serves as a replacement for the steam supply previously provided by a combined heat and power (CHP) facility at Chemours that is no longer operational. The boiler burns natural gas as its sole fuel source to generate steam at pressures between 20-50 bar, which is classified as high-pressure industrial steam suitable for various process applications.\n\nThe technology operates by combusting natural gas in a controlled combustion chamber, where the chemical energy in the fuel is converted to thermal energy. This heat is transferred through heat exchanger tubes to water, producing high-pressure steam. With an input of 0.0366 PJ of natural gas yielding 0.0315 PJ of steam output, the system achieves approximately 86% thermal efficiency, which represents the conversion of fuel energy to useful steam energy, with losses primarily occurring through flue gas heat and radiation.\n\nNatural gas combustion offers significant environmental advantages compared to heavier fossil fuels like coal or fuel oil, producing lower carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy and minimal sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and nitrogen oxide emissions. The high efficiency of modern natural gas boilers further reduces fuel consumption and associated emissions. Backup boilers like this are commonly deployed in chemical plants, refineries, pharmaceutical facilities, and other industrial operations that require reliable steam supply for process heating, sterilization, power generation, or as a heat transfer medium in manufacturing processes.",

    "detailed_description": "Formaldehyde production through this three-stage process converts methanol into formaldehyde, a critical industrial chemical used extensively in manufacturing resins, plastics, and building materials. The system integrates an evaporator for methanol preparation, a catalytic reactor for oxidation, and a concentrator to achieve the desired product strength. This technology produces 1 kt (kiloton) of formaldehyde from 1.16 kt of methanol feedstock, representing approximately 86% conversion efficiency on a mass basis.\n\nThe process begins with the evaporator, where methanol is vaporized using steam (5.66 TJ) to create a gaseous feed stream at the appropriate temperature and pressure for the reactor. The vaporized methanol then enters a catalytic reactor where it undergoes partial oxidation with air (oxygen from ambient air, not listed as a metered input), converting it to formaldehyde through an exothermic reaction over metal oxide catalysts, typically silver or iron-molybdenum based systems. The reactor section generates significant heat from this exothermic oxidation reaction, which can be partially recovered. Finally, the concentrator section uses electricity (0.752 TJ) to operate pumps, fans, and control systems while absorbing the formaldehyde gas into water and concentrating it to commercial specifications, typically 37-50% aqueous solution.\n\nThis technology offers environmental benefits through energy recovery from the exothermic oxidation reaction, which can offset some of the thermal energy requirements and reduce overall fuel consumption. The relatively modest electricity consumption (0.752 TJ per kiloton of product) indicates efficient design with minimal auxiliary power needs. The process minimizes waste generation when properly controlled, as the primary byproducts are water vapor and small amounts of unreacted methanol that can be recycled.\n\nFormaldehyde produced through this method serves numerous industrial applications including manufacturing urea-formaldehyde and phenol-formaldehyde resins for plywood and particleboard, producing polyacetal plastics, synthesizing chemicals like pentaerythritol and hexamine, and creating disinfectants and preservatives. The chemical industry relies heavily on this production route due to its scalability and well-established process control methodologies.",

POM, also known as acetal resin, is valued for its exceptional mechanical strength, dimensional stability, and low friction properties, making it an ideal replacement for metal components in precision engineering applications.\n\nThe production process operates in three integrated stages using formaldehyde as the primary feedstock. First, formaldehyde undergoes reactive extraction where it forms hemiformal intermediates. The hemiformal is then fed into a pyrolyzer where thermal cracking occurs, breaking down the hemiformal molecules using steam energy (7.05 TJ) to generate reactive monomers. These monomers proceed to the polymerization stage where they chain together to form long POM polymer chains, with electrical energy (0.597 TJ) powering the process controls, mixing equipment, and polymer finishing operations. The technology converts 1.06 kilotons of formaldehyde into 1 kiloton of finished POM product.\n\nFrom an efficiency perspective, this process demonstrates excellent material utilization with minimal waste generation, as the conversion ratio approaches stoichiometric efficiency. The relatively modest energy requirements, particularly the low electricity consumption compared to alternative polymer production methods, contribute to reduced carbon footprint and operational costs. The direct conversion pathway eliminates the need for extensive purification steps or solvent recovery systems.\n\nPOM produced through this technology finds extensive application in automotive components (fuel system parts, gears, and interior mechanisms), consumer electronics housings, industrial machinery parts, and medical devices where precision, durability, and chemical resistance are critical requirements.",

This technology represents the final stage of POM processing, where the polymer that has already been synthesized is physically transformed into a standardized product form that manufacturers can easily handle, transport, and process in their equipment.\n\nThe production process involves three integrated unit operations working in sequence. First, a centrifuge separates any residual moisture or processing fluids from the POM material through high-speed rotation. The material then moves to a dryer where heated air removes remaining moisture to achieve the low moisture content required for high-quality pellets, as POM is hygroscopic and moisture can degrade its properties during subsequent processing. Finally, an extruder melts and pumps the dried POM through a die plate with multiple holes, creating continuous strands that are immediately cooled and cut into uniform cylindrical pellets, typically 2-4mm in length.\n\nThe process requires 1 kiloton of bulk POM material as feedstock and consumes 1.59 terajoules of electricity to power the centrifuge motors, dryer heating elements and fans, extruder barrel heaters, screw drive motors, and pelletizing equipment. The output is 1 kiloton of finished POM pellets with consistent size, shape, and bulk density properties. This finishing process offers efficiency benefits by creating a free-flowing product that prevents material bridging in storage hoppers, enables accurate metering in processing equipment, and reduces dust generation compared to powder forms, thereby minimizing material waste and improving workplace air quality.\n\nPOM pellets are widely used in precision engineering applications including automotive components (fuel system parts, door handles, gear wheels), consumer electronics housings, industrial conveyor components, and medical device parts where dimensional stability, low friction, and excellent mechanical properties are required.",

The primary purpose is to maximize energy utilization efficiency by simultaneously producing two useful forms of energy from a single fuel source, rather than generating them separately.\n\nThe system operates by combusting fuel (0.041 PJ) in a boiler to generate high-temperature, high-pressure steam. In a CHP configuration, this steam first passes through a steam turbine connected to an electrical generator, producing electricity (0.003 PJ) as it expands and loses pressure. The steam exiting the turbine, still at elevated pressure and temperature, is then used directly for industrial heating processes or other thermal applications, delivering 0.0315 PJ of useful thermal energy. This cascading use of energy represents a fundamental advantage over separate generation systems.\n\nThe technology achieves an impressive combined energy efficiency of approximately 78% (0.0345 PJ output from 0.041 PJ input), significantly higher than conventional separate heat and power generation which typically wastes substantial energy through heat rejection. This integrated approach reduces fuel consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions per unit of useful energy delivered. The environmental benefits include lower carbon dioxide emissions, reduced air pollutants, and decreased fuel resource depletion compared to operating standalone power plants and boilers.\n\nSteam boilers and CHP systems are commonly deployed in industries with substantial simultaneous electricity and process heat demands, such as chemical manufacturing, petroleum refining, pulp and paper production, food processing, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

This technology significantly improves overall energy efficiency by capturing and utilizing heat that would otherwise be wasted in conventional separate heat and power generation systems.\n\nThe system operates by combusting natural gas in a prime mover, typically a gas turbine or reciprocating engine, which drives a generator to produce electricity. The hot exhaust gases from this combustion process, rather than being vented to the atmosphere, are directed through a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) where they transfer their thermal energy to water, producing low pressure steam at 1-9 bar. This sequential use of energy from the fuel source is what makes CHP systems substantially more efficient than separate generation methods.\n\nFrom an input of 0.0537 petajoules of natural gas, this CHP configuration generates 0.0315 PJ of low pressure steam and 0.0166 PJ of electricity, achieving a combined energy output that represents approximately 90% fuel utilization efficiency compared to roughly 45-55% for conventional separate generation. This efficiency advantage translates directly into reduced fuel consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions per unit of useful energy delivered, and decreased operating costs. The environmental benefit is substantial, as CHP systems can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 30-40% compared to producing the same amounts of heat and power separately.\n\nIndustrial applications for low pressure steam CHP plants are widespread and include chemical processing facilities, petroleum refineries, pulp and paper manufacturing, food processing plants, and district heating systems where both electricity and process steam are needed continuously.

Electricity (18.4 GJ) powers the pumping systems that both inject water into the formation and extract the dissolved brine, while diesel (0.00512 kt) typically fuels auxiliary equipment or backup generators.

In Multiple Effect Vaporization, the vapor produced in one evaporation stage is used to heat the next stage, creating a cascade effect that maximizes heat utilization across 4-5 sequential vessels. Mechanical Vapour Recompression enhances efficiency by mechanically compressing low-pressure vapor to increase its temperature, allowing it to be reused as a heating medium rather than being discharged, thus recycling thermal energy within the system.\n\nThe technology requires 3.58 kilotonnes of purified brine at 25% salt concentration and 1.25 terajoules of heat energy as inputs.

This physical separation method requires minimal energy input, consuming only 0.00273 GJ of electricity per processing cycle to operate the centrifuge motor and auxiliary systems.\n\nThe technology operates by feeding 1.09 kilotons of salt slurry into the centrifuge basket, where rapid rotation forces the denser salt crystals against the perforated walls while allowing the lighter liquid phase, known as mother liquor, to pass through the perforations and drain away. The process yields 1 kiloton of salt product at 98% purity as the main output, along with 0.164 kilotons of separated mother liquor that contains dissolved salts and residual water.

Electricity input of 0.17 TJ powers pumps, controls, and auxiliary equipment necessary to move the viscous caustic solution through the effects and maintain appropriate vacuum conditions in the later stages. From 1.56 kt of input caustic soda solution, the system produces 1 kt of concentrated 50% caustic soda and separates 0.563 kt of water.\n\nThe environmental and efficiency benefits of five-effect MEV are substantial compared to single-effect evaporation, as the multiple-effect configuration reduces steam consumption by approximately 80% through vapor reuse. This dramatic reduction in primary steam requirements translates directly to lower energy costs and reduced greenhouse gas emissions from steam generation. The technology also operates as a closed system with minimal emissions, and the separated water can potentially be treated and reused in other plant processes.\n\nMultiple effect vaporization systems are standard in the chlor-alkali industry for concentrating caustic soda to commercial specifications, as well as in pulp and paper mills, food processing facilities for juice and dairy concentration, and desalination plants. The technology is particularly valuable where large volumes of dilute aqueous solutions must be concentrated continuously and where energy efficiency is economically critical due to high throughput requirements.",

    "laymans_description": "This technology concentrates caustic soda solution from a weaker 32% concentration to a stronger 50% concentration by evaporating excess water, using a energy-efficient process called Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR).",
    "detailed_description": "Vaporization with Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR) is a concentration technology designed to increase the strength of caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) solution from 32% to 50% concentration through energy-efficient evaporation. This process is essential in the chlor-alkali industry where caustic soda is produced initially at lower concentrations and must be concentrated for various industrial applications requiring higher strength solutions.\n\nThe MVR system operates by using a mechanical compressor to recycle and reuse vapor generated during the evaporation process. The technology takes 1.56 kilotonnes of 32% caustic soda solution along with 0.34 TJ of low-pressure steam (1-9 bar) and 0.169 TJ of electricity as inputs. The evaporation process removes water from the solution, with the vapor being compressed by an electrically-driven compressor to increase its temperature and pressure. This compressed vapor then serves as the heating medium for the evaporator, creating a self-sustaining thermal cycle that significantly reduces external steam requirements. The process yields 1 kilotonne of concentrated 50% caustic soda solution and 0.563 kilotonnes of separated water.\n\nThe primary environmental and efficiency benefit of MVR technology is its substantial reduction in energy consumption compared to conventional multi-effect evaporation systems. By mechanically recompressing and reusing the vapor instead of requiring continuous fresh steam input, the system can achieve energy savings of 60-80% compared to traditional methods. The relatively modest electricity consumption of 0.169 TJ to drive the compressor is far more efficient than the thermal energy that would otherwise be needed, making this an economically attractive and environmentally responsible concentration method.\n\nThis technology is widely applied in the chlor-alkali industry for producing commercial-grade concentrated caustic soda, in chemical manufacturing facilities requiring on-site caustic concentration, and in industrial operations where caustic soda at 50% concentration is preferred for transportation efficiency and storage economy. The technology is particularly valuable in facilities with limited steam availability or where energy costs represent a significant portion of operating expenses.",

The process yields purified hydrogen as the main output plus an additional 1 kiloton of hydrogen in gaseous form, presumably at lower pressure or purity levels.\n\nThis technology offers significant environmental benefits by enabling efficient hydrogen storage and distribution without chemical conversion, relying solely on physical processes. The ability to densify hydrogen reduces transportation costs and storage volume requirements, making hydrogen a more viable clean energy carrier. The process is relatively energy-efficient compared to chemical purification methods, using only electricity and cooling water without generating chemical waste streams.\n\nTypical industrial applications include hydrogen refueling stations for fuel cell vehicles, industrial gas supply networks, chemical manufacturing facilities requiring high-purity hydrogen feedstock, and renewable energy storage systems where hydrogen serves as an energy buffer.

    "detailed_description": "Malt production is a controlled germination and drying process that converts raw barley into malt, a key ingredient in brewing and distilling industries. The process activates enzymes within the barley grain that break down starches and proteins, making them accessible for fermentation and developing flavor compounds essential for beer, whiskey, and other products.\n\nThe malting process begins with pre-processing and steeping, where 1.33 tonnes of raw barley are cleaned and soaked in 3.25 tonnes of water to raise the grain's moisture content to approximately 45%, triggering germination. During the germination phase, the barley is spread out under controlled temperature and humidity conditions, allowing the grain to sprout and develop enzymatic activity over several days. The process concludes with kilning, where medium-pressure steam (1930 MJ at 10-19 bar) and electricity (324 MJ) are used to halt germination by drying and heating the grain to develop color and flavor while preserving the enzymes. Finally, de-culming removes the dried rootlets and shoots, producing 1 tonne of finished malt and 0.0325 tonnes of waste grains (culms) as a byproduct.\n\nThe malting process offers efficiency benefits through its high conversion ratio, transforming 1.33 tonnes of raw barley into 1 tonne of value-added malt while generating culms that can be repurposed as animal feed, minimizing waste. The controlled use of steam and electricity ensures consistent product quality while optimizing energy consumption throughout the multi-day process. Malt production is fundamental to the brewing industry for beer production, the distilling industry for whiskey and spirits manufacturing, and the food industry for malt extracts used in cereals, malted milk products, and baking applications.",

This system combines milling, mashing, lautering, and boiling operations in a controlled environment to extract fermentable sugars from malt and infuse the characteristic bitterness and aroma from hops.\n\nThe process begins with mixing 16.5 kg of milled malt with 3.8 hectolitres of water in a mash tun, where the mixture is heated using 20 MJ of steam to activate enzymes that convert starches into fermentable sugars. The resulting mash is then separated through lautering, which filters the liquid wort from the solid spent grains, producing two distinct outputs: clarified wort and spent grain residue. The filtered wort proceeds to the kettle where it is boiled with 150 kg of hops, utilizing steam energy to sterilize the liquid, concentrate the sugars, and extract the desired bittering compounds and aromatic oils from the hops. Throughout these operations, 3.6 MJ of electricity powers pumps, agitators, and control systems that maintain precise temperature profiles and fluid transfers.\n\nModern brewhouses offer significant efficiency benefits through heat recovery systems that capture steam condensate and redirect thermal energy between process stages, reducing overall energy consumption per batch.

This improved efficiency translates directly to reduced fuel consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions per unit of useful energy produced, and decreased operating costs.

The recovered thermal energy is converted into low-pressure steam (1-9 bar), suitable for various industrial heating applications.\n\nFrom 0.067 PJ of spent grain feedstock, the system generates 0.0315 PJ of low-pressure steam and 0.0275 PJ of electricity, achieving a combined energy recovery of approximately 87% of the input energy content. This high efficiency stems from the dual-output nature of CHP systems, which utilize both the mechanical energy for electricity generation and the thermal byproduct that would otherwise be wasted.\n\nThis technology provides significant environmental benefits by diverting organic waste from landfills, reducing methane emissions from decomposition, and displacing fossil fuel consumption for both heat and power generation. Typical industrial applications include breweries, distilleries, grain processing facilities, and food manufacturing plants where spent grains are abundant and there is concurrent demand for both process heat and electricity on-site.",

The technology addresses the dual challenge of managing organic waste while producing renewable energy for industrial heating applications. Spent grains, which contain residual sugars, proteins, and cellulosic materials, serve as the feedstock for microbial decomposition in oxygen-free conditions.\n\nThe digestion process occurs in sealed tanks where microorganisms break down the organic matter in spent grains through several stages: hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. The biogas produced, primarily composed of methane and carbon dioxide, is captured and combusted in boilers or combined heat and power systems to generate steam. In this configuration, 0.0371 PJ of spent grains input yields 0.0315 PJ of low-pressure steam (1-9 bar), representing approximately 85% energy conversion efficiency when accounting for process losses and parasitic energy requirements.\n\nThis technology offers significant environmental benefits by diverting organic waste from landfills, where it would otherwise decompose and release methane directly into the atmosphere, and by displacing fossil fuel consumption for steam generation.

The technology serves the critical purpose of converting wet slag into a dry, stable material suitable for various industrial applications, particularly in cement production and construction materials.\n\nThe system operates by combusting natural gas to generate thermal energy, which is then applied to wet blast furnace slag through direct or indirect heating methods. For every 1.2 tonnes of wet slag processed, the dryer consumes 0.414 gigajoules of natural gas, producing approximately 1 tonne of dried material. The heat transfer removes moisture content through evaporation, reducing the slag's weight while increasing its material density and usability. The combustion process provides controlled, consistent heat that efficiently drives off water content without degrading the slag's beneficial properties.\n\nThis drying technology offers significant environmental and efficiency benefits by enabling the productive reuse of what would otherwise be an industrial waste product. By transforming wet slag into dried material, the process reduces landfill requirements and creates a valuable supplementary cementitious material that can replace a portion of energy-intensive Portland cement in concrete production. The relatively modest natural gas consumption makes this an energy-efficient method for slag processing compared to alternative drying techniques.\n\nNatural gas-fired slag dryers are commonly employed in integrated steel mills and standalone slag processing facilities, where they serve as essential infrastructure for valorizing blast furnace byproducts.

The system represents a hybrid grinding approach that combines the energy efficiency of roller press pre-grinding with the fine finishing capabilities of ball mills.\n\nThe process works by first feeding the raw materials through a roller press, which uses high pressure between two counter-rotating rollers to compress and pre-grind the materials into smaller particles. This pre-crushed material then passes through two ball mills in sequence, where rotating cylinders filled with steel balls further pulverize and homogenize the mixture to achieve the required cement fineness, typically measured in Blaine surface area. The roller press significantly reduces the energy load on the ball mills by performing initial size reduction more efficiently than traditional grinding alone.\n\nThis configuration offers substantial environmental and efficiency benefits compared to conventional ball mill-only systems, as the roller press can reduce overall grinding energy consumption by 30-40%. The high proportion of blast furnace slag (60.4%) in the mixture creates a blended cement with lower embodied carbon compared to Portland cement, since slag is a by-product that requires no additional clinker production. The reduced clinker content (31.2%) directly translates to lower CO2 emissions, as clinker production is the most carbon-intensive step in cement manufacturing.\n\nThis technology is widely used in cement plants producing composite or blended cements, particularly CEM II and CEM III type cements according to European standards.

The system operates on the refrigeration cycle principle, where a refrigerant is compressed and expanded through various stages to transfer thermal energy efficiently. By consuming 0.104 GJ of electricity, the heat pump can generate significantly more thermal energy than direct electric heating would provide, typically achieving coefficients of performance (COP) between 3 and 5, meaning it produces 3-5 units of heat for every unit of electricity consumed.\n\nThe process takes 1.2 tonnes of wet blast furnace slag as input and subjects it to controlled heating through the heat pump's evaporator-compressor-condenser cycle. The refrigerant absorbs heat at low temperature and pressure in the evaporator, is compressed to high temperature and pressure, then releases this concentrated heat in the condenser section where it dries the slag. The dried slag output can then be utilized in cement production, road construction, or other industrial applications where moisture content must be minimized.\n\nThis technology offers substantial environmental and efficiency benefits compared to traditional direct-fired dryers that burn coal or natural gas. The heat pump approach reduces primary energy consumption by 60-75% and eliminates direct combustion emissions, while the electrical input can potentially be sourced from renewable energy. The system is particularly valuable in steel production facilities where large quantities of slag require processing, as well as in cement plants and aggregate production operations that utilize slag as a supplementary material.

For every 1.2 tonnes of wet blast furnace slag fed into the system, 0.414 GJ of green gas energy is consumed to produce approximately 1 tonne of dried slag, indicating a moisture removal of roughly 0.2 tonnes per batch.

These components are fed through the roller press where initial compaction occurs, followed by fine grinding in the vertical roller mills which use grinding rollers rotating against a grinding table to pulverize the material. The entire grinding operation requires 0.209 GJ of electricity to produce one tonne of finished cement. The high proportion of blast furnace slag (over 60% by weight) in this formulation creates what is known as slag cement or ground granulated blast furnace slag cement.\n\nThis technology offers significant environmental benefits by incorporating industrial waste material (blast furnace slag) as the primary component, thereby reducing the clinker content to just 31.2% compared to traditional Portland cement which uses approximately 95% clinker.

This process serves as the critical final manufacturing step that gives wall tiles their strength, durability, and aesthetic properties by inducing permanent chemical and physical changes in the ceramic material.\n\nThe technology operates by combusting green gas (renewable biogas or synthetic methane) as the primary fuel source to generate the intense heat required for the firing process, which typically reaches temperatures between 1000-1200°C. The process begins with 1.05 tonnes of dried wall tiles entering the kiln, where the controlled combustion of 4.48 GJ of green gas provides the thermal energy necessary to trigger sintering reactions that fuse ceramic particles together. An electrical input of 0.983 GJ powers auxiliary systems including kiln motors, control systems, and ventilation equipment. As tiles move through different temperature zones in the kiln, they undergo dehydration, organic burnout, and vitrification phases that transform the porous dried material into dense, impermeable ceramic products.\n\nThe process generates 1 tonne of finished wall tiles as the main output, with approximately 0.0454 tonnes of recycled material produced from broken or defective pieces that can be ground and reintroduced into earlier production stages. An integrated heat recovery system captures hot air used for product cooling and redirects it to drying chambers, significantly improving overall thermal efficiency by reusing waste heat that would otherwise be lost to the atmosphere.\n\nThe primary environmental benefit of this technology is the substitution of fossil natural gas with green gas, which dramatically reduces carbon emissions associated with tile production since green gas is derived from renewable sources like agricultural waste, sewage, or synthetic production using renewable electricity. This fuel switching can reduce the carbon footprint of the firing process by 80-95% compared to conventional natural gas firing.

This system operates by applying electrical current to demineralized water, causing water molecules to split into hydrogen and oxygen gases through an electrochemical process. The technology is particularly valued for its high efficiency, compact design, and ability to produce high-purity hydrogen suitable for various industrial applications.\n\nThe electrolyser works by passing electricity through demineralized (demi) water in the presence of a proton exchange membrane that separates the anode and cathode compartments. At the anode, water molecules are oxidized to produce oxygen gas, protons, and electrons. The protons migrate through the membrane while electrons travel through an external circuit, and both recombine at the cathode to form hydrogen gas. For this specific configuration, the system consumes 0.196 PJ of electricity and 14.5 kt of demi water to produce 1 kt of hydrogen gas.\n\nPEM electrolysers offer significant environmental benefits as they produce zero direct emissions when powered by renewable electricity, enabling truly green hydrogen production.

The system involves converting existing natural gas-fired boilers to combust hydrogen instead, enabling industrial facilities to produce thermal energy and electrical power simultaneously while eliminating direct carbon emissions. According to Element Energy research, straightforward industrial sites can implement this conversion by 2023, while more complex facilities may require until 2025 for full retrofit completion.\n\nThe plant operates by combusting hydrogen gas in a modified boiler system, where the hydrogen undergoes complete oxidation with oxygen to produce water vapor and release significant thermal energy. This heat generates high-pressure steam at 20-50 bar, which drives a turbine generator to produce electricity while the remaining steam pressure serves process heating needs. From an input of 0.082 PJ of hydrogen gas, the system delivers 0.0315 PJ each of high-pressure steam and electricity, representing a combined efficiency where waste heat recovery maximizes energy utilization from the hydrogen fuel.\n\nThe primary environmental benefit of this technology is zero carbon dioxide emissions at the point of use, as hydrogen combustion produces only water vapor as a byproduct, making it a clean alternative to fossil fuel-fired CHP systems. The cogeneration approach provides efficiency advantages over separate heat and power generation, reducing overall energy consumption and fuel requirements.

In the Klazienaveen plant, this technology specifically processes dry peat through rotating cylindrical vessels that are heated externally, causing the material to undergo pyrolysis as it tumbles through the kiln. The absence of oxygen is critical to prevent combustion and instead promote the thermal decomposition of the peat into carbonized material, releasing volatile compounds while concentrating the carbon content in the solid residue.\n\nThe process operates by feeding 4.6 kilotons of dry peat into the rotary kiln, where the material is subjected to elevated temperatures typically ranging from 300°C to 600°C depending on the desired product characteristics. As the kiln rotates, the peat moves through different temperature zones, ensuring uniform heat exposure and complete carbonization. The rotating action provides continuous mixing and prevents hot spots or incomplete conversion, while the controlled atmosphere maintains oxygen-free conditions throughout the vessel.\n\nFrom an environmental perspective, carbonization in rotary kilns offers benefits over direct combustion by producing a stable, carbon-rich material that can serve as a solid fuel with higher energy density than the original peat, or as a soil amendment. The process also captures volatile organic compounds that would otherwise be released during natural decomposition or uncontrolled burning.

This foundational refinery operation processes 3.7 kilotons of crude oil through a tall distillation column where temperature decreases from bottom to top, allowing different petroleum products to be extracted at specific heights corresponding to their vaporization temperatures.\n\nThe process works by heating the crude oil using refinery gas (1990 GJ) as fuel and injecting high-pressure steam (1240 GJ at 20-50 bar) to reduce the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, facilitating vaporization at lower temperatures. The heated crude enters the atmospheric column where lighter components vaporize and rise while heavier fractions remain liquid and descend. The column operates at approximately atmospheric pressure with multiple draw-off trays at different temperature zones, each collecting a specific fraction as it condenses. Electricity (68.1 GJ) powers pumps, control systems, and auxiliary equipment throughout the unit.\n\nFrom the 3.7 kilotons of crude oil input, the process yields multiple valuable products: 1 kiloton of naphtha (the main output used for gasoline blending or petrochemicals), 0.58 kilotons of kerosene (jet fuel), 0.658 kilotons of diesel, 1.03 kilotons of vacuum gasoil, and 0.427 kilotons of vacuum residue for further processing. The process also generates 3330 GJ of refinery gas as a byproduct, which can be recycled as fuel within the refinery, demonstrating inherent energy recovery that improves overall facility efficiency.\n\nAtmospheric distillation is employed in virtually every petroleum refinery worldwide as the essential first-stage separation process, with typical applications ranging from small refineries processing 10,000 barrels per day to massive integrated complexes handling over 500,000 barrels daily.

The technology serves as a critical secondary separation step in petroleum refining to extract additional valuable products from the heaviest streams remaining after atmospheric distillation.\n\nThe process operates by feeding 1.35 kilotonnes of vacuum gasoil into a tall fractionation column maintained under vacuum conditions. The system requires 599 GJ of refinery gas for fired heating to vaporize the feed components, while 513 GJ of high-pressure steam (20-50 bar) provides stripping steam in the column bottom to enhance vaporization and maintain vacuum integrity. A modest 11.2 GJ of electricity powers vacuum pumps, ejectors, and auxiliary equipment necessary to maintain the reduced pressure environment throughout the column.\n\nThe process yields three distinct product streams with different boiling ranges and molecular weights: 1 kilotonne of vacuum distillate as the primary product, 0.347 kilotonnes of light distillate, and 0.367 kilotonnes of short residue (the heaviest non-vaporized fraction). These fractions serve as feedstocks for downstream processes such as catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, and lubricant base oil production.\n\nVacuum distillation provides significant environmental and efficiency benefits by maximizing the recovery of usable hydrocarbons from crude oil while minimizing energy consumption compared to atmospheric pressure alternatives.

    "detailed_description": "Gasification for hydrogen production is a thermochemical conversion process that transforms residual fuel oil into hydrogen-rich gas through partial oxidation at high temperatures. This technology serves as an industrial-scale method for producing hydrogen gas, which is essential for various refining and chemical manufacturing processes. The process operates by reacting heavy hydrocarbon feedstocks with controlled amounts of oxygen in a high-temperature, high-pressure environment, rather than allowing complete combustion.\n\nThe technical process begins by feeding 5.79 kilotons of residual oil along with 5.52 kilotons of pure oxygen gas into a gasification reactor operating at temperatures typically between 1200-1500°C. Very high-pressure steam (51-100 bar) totaling 18.3 terajoules is injected to facilitate the gasification reactions and helps convert the hydrocarbons into synthesis gas (syngas) containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The partial oxidation conditions ensure that the fuel oil does not fully combust but instead breaks down into gaseous components through a series of complex chemical reactions including steam reforming and water-gas shift reactions.\n\nThe primary output is 1 kiloton of purified hydrogen gas suitable for industrial applications, along with 37.4 terajoules of recovered very high-pressure steam that can be used elsewhere in integrated facilities, representing significant energy recovery. Additionally, 43 terajoules of fuel gas is produced as a byproduct, which can be utilized for heating or power generation within the facility. This energy integration provides efficiency benefits by recovering waste heat and utilizing byproduct streams, reducing overall energy consumption and improving the carbon intensity compared to hydrogen production methods that waste these energy streams.\n\nTypical industrial applications include petroleum refineries where hydrogen is needed for hydrocracking and hydrotreating processes, ammonia production facilities, methanol synthesis plants, and chemical manufacturing operations requiring large volumes of hydrogen feedstock. The technology is particularly valuable for facilities that have access to residual oil streams and need to convert low-value heavy hydrocarbons into high-value hydrogen while maintaining energy efficiency through steam and fuel gas recovery.",

This process maximizes the yield of transportable fuels from residual oil feedstock that would otherwise have limited commercial value, making it particularly useful for processing heavy crude oils and upgrading refinery bottoms.\n\nThe technology operates through a multi-stage fluidized bed system where residual oil feedstock undergoes thermal cracking at elevated temperatures. The process requires 3.12 kilotonnes of residual oil and 258 gigajoules of electricity to facilitate operations such as pumping, heating, and process control. The thermal cracking breaks down large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller ones, producing a range of fuel products including gasoline (0.586 kt), kerosene (0.436 kt), diesel (1 kt as the main output), and LPG (0.156 kt).

By gasifying the coke that would otherwise accumulate as a low-value solid byproduct, the technology minimizes disposal challenges and produces useful fuel gas for internal energy consumption. This approach improves overall refinery carbon efficiency and reduces the environmental footprint associated with coke handling and storage.

The system takes natural gas as fuel and air for combustion, producing both useful heat in the form of high-pressure steam (20-50 bar) and electrical power as co-products.\n\nThe technology operates by combusting natural gas (0.0701 PJ) with air (26 kt) in a gas turbine or engine to generate electricity (0.021 PJ). The hot exhaust gases from this primary combustion process, rather than being wasted, are directed through a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) where they produce high-pressure steam (0.0315 PJ at 20-50 bar). This sequential use of energy from a single fuel source is what distinguishes CHP from conventional separate heat and power generation.\n\nThe environmental and efficiency benefits are substantial, as CHP systems typically achieve overall energy conversion efficiencies of 70-90%, compared to approximately 50% for conventional separate generation. By capturing and utilizing waste heat that would otherwise be rejected to the atmosphere, the system reduces fuel consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions per unit of useful energy output. This translates to lower carbon intensity and reduced operational costs for the refinery.\n\nIn refinery applications, the high-pressure steam output is used extensively for distillation columns, heat exchangers, crude oil heating, and driving steam turbines for pumps and compressors, while the electricity powers motors, lighting, and control systems.

Under these conditions, sulfur compounds are converted to hydrogen sulfide gas (0.00207 kt output), while nitrogen and other heteroatoms are similarly removed, producing clean hydrotreated diesel (1 kt output) with significantly reduced impurity levels.\n\nThe environmental benefits of this electrified approach are substantial, as it eliminates direct CO2 emissions from furnace combustion when powered by renewable electricity sources, while still achieving the critical environmental objective of producing low-sulfur diesel that reduces air pollution from vehicle emissions. The process efficiency is enhanced through precise electrical heating control and heat integration via steam systems, resulting in lower overall energy intensity compared to conventional gas-fired hydrotreating units.\n\nThis technology finds widespread application in petroleum refineries globally, particularly in regions with strict fuel specifications such as the European Union and North America where diesel sulfur content must be below 10-15 ppm. It is especially valuable for refineries seeking to decarbonize operations while maintaining product quality and meeting increasingly stringent environmental standards.",

High-pressure steam (652 GJ at 20-50 bar) provides the thermal energy required for vaporization and creates stripping action that enhances separation efficiency in the column.

    "detailed_description": "Polyol production involves the catalytic polymerization of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide to create polyether polyols, which are essential intermediates for manufacturing polyurethanes and other polymer products. This particular process configuration produces both polyethylene glycol (PEG) from ethylene oxide and polypropylene glycol (PPG) in both soft and rigid grades from propylene oxide, with the product distribution optimized based on facility capacity at Terneuzen.\n\nThe process operates by feeding ethylene oxide (0.345 kt) and propylene oxide (0.678 kt) as primary monomers, along with small amounts of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol (0.00177 kt each) that serve as initiator molecules to control the polymer chain length and molecular weight distribution. The polymerization occurs through ring-opening reactions in the presence of catalysts, where the oxide monomers sequentially add to the growing polymer chains. The process requires low-pressure steam (1.06 TJ at 1-9 bar) for temperature control and reaction heating, while electricity (0.124 TJ) powers mixing equipment, pumps, and process control systems.\n\nThe technology offers environmental benefits through its relatively efficient conversion of raw materials with minimal waste generation, as the polymerization reactions achieve high selectivity when properly controlled. The higher input ratio of propylene oxide to ethylene oxide reflects the production focus on PPG variants, which constitute the majority of output with 265 kt of soft PPG and 110 kt of rigid PPG compared to the PEG production stream.\n\nPolyether polyols find widespread industrial applications primarily in the polyurethane industry, where they serve as key components for flexible and rigid foams used in furniture cushioning, mattresses, automotive seating, building insulation, and refrigeration panels.

    "detailed_description": "A Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plant utilizing very high-pressure steam with hydrogen as fuel is a cogeneration system that has been retrofitted from natural gas to burn pure hydrogen, producing both electricity and useful thermal energy simultaneously. This technology addresses the challenge of decarbonizing industrial heating and power generation by replacing fossil fuel combustion with zero-carbon hydrogen fuel, which produces only water vapor as a combustion byproduct. The retrofit involves modifications to existing natural gas-fired boilers, including changes to burner systems, flame detection equipment, and safety systems to accommodate hydrogen's different combustion characteristics, such as its higher flame speed and wider flammability range.\n\nThe system operates by combusting hydrogen gas as the sole fuel input (0.07 PJ) in a high-pressure boiler to generate steam at very high pressures, typically above 40 bar. This steam drives a turbine to produce electricity while the exhaust heat and lower-pressure steam extracted from the turbine provide thermal energy for industrial processes or district heating. The cogeneration approach achieves overall system efficiencies of 70-90%, significantly higher than separate heat and power generation, by capturing and utilizing waste heat that would otherwise be lost.\n\nThe primary environmental benefit is the complete elimination of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions at the point of use, as hydrogen combustion produces only water and nitrogen oxides (which can be controlled through combustion design). The high overall efficiency of CHP systems means maximum useful energy is extracted from the hydrogen fuel input, reducing total fuel requirements compared to separate generation systems. According to Element Energy research, simple industrial sites can implement hydrogen-fired CHP by 2023 and more complex facilities by 2025, making this technology applicable for industries requiring both substantial heat and power, such as chemical manufacturing, refineries, food processing, and pharmaceutical production.",

The oxidation reaction is exothermic and occurs under elevated temperature and pressure conditions, requiring careful thermal management through high-pressure steam (0.963 GJ) for process heating and substantial cooling water (251 tonne) for temperature control and product crystallization.

The technology produces purified terephthalic acid with typically greater than 99.9% purity, meeting stringent specifications required for downstream polymerization processes.\n\nThis technology offers environmental benefits through relatively high conversion efficiency and the use of air rather than pure oxygen, reducing operational complexity and energy consumption associated with oxygen separation. The process design minimizes waste generation and allows for effective heat integration, with the exothermic oxidation providing thermal energy that can be recovered.

This process represents the final polymerization stage where pre-polymer materials are converted into high-molecular-weight PET resin with the specific properties required for blow-molding into bottles.\n\nThe process works by combining purified terephthalic acid (0.841 tonne) and mono-ethylene glycol (0.323 tonne) as the primary reactants, with a small amount of isophthalic acid (0.0237 tonne) added as a co-monomer to modify the polymer properties and improve processability.

This technology is essential for producing PET resins with the mechanical strength, clarity, and barrier properties required for beverage bottle applications, as fiber-grade PET lacks the necessary characteristics for demanding packaging uses.\n\nThe SSP process operates by heating fiber-grade PET pellets or chips in a solid crystalline state, typically at temperatures between 200-230°C, which is below the polymer's melting point but high enough to allow molecular chain growth through continued polycondensation reactions. The technology requires 1 tonne of fiber-grade PET feedstock as the base material, with 0.43 GJ of high-pressure steam (20-50 bar) providing the thermal energy necessary to maintain the reaction temperature throughout the crystalline polymer matrix. A relatively small amount of electricity (0.0113 GJ) powers auxiliary equipment such as conveying systems, control mechanisms, and material handling components. During the process, small molecules like ethylene glycol and water, which are byproducts of the polycondensation reaction, diffuse out of the solid polymer particles, allowing the molecular chains to extend and link together to achieve the higher molecular weight characteristic of bottle-grade PET.\n\nFrom an efficiency perspective, SSP technology offers significant advantages as it operates in the solid phase rather than requiring energy-intensive melt processing, making it more energy-efficient than alternative upgrading methods.

    "detailed_description": "A hydrogen thermal oil heater (retrofit) is a modified industrial heating system that produces hot oil for use as a heat transfer agent by combusting hydrogen gas as fuel. This technology involves retrofitting existing natural gas-fired thermal oil heaters with specialized hydrogen burners, allowing facilities to transition from fossil fuel heating to zero-carbon hydrogen combustion while retaining the existing thermal oil circulation infrastructure and heat exchanger systems.\n\nThe system operates by feeding hydrogen gas at an input rate of 0.0354 PJ into specially designed burners that accommodate hydrogen's unique combustion characteristics, including its higher flame speed and wider flammability range compared to natural gas. When combusted with air, the hydrogen produces a high-temperature flame that heats thermal oil (typically synthetic or mineral-based heat transfer fluids) circulating through heating coils or tubes. The heated oil, which can reach temperatures between 200-400°C depending on system design, then flows through a closed-loop system to deliver process heat to various industrial applications before returning to be reheated.\n\nThis retrofit technology offers significant environmental benefits as hydrogen combustion produces only water vapor as a byproduct, eliminating carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides (with proper burner design), and particulate emissions associated with natural gas or oil combustion. The ability to retrofit existing equipment also provides capital cost savings and reduces material waste compared to complete system replacement.\n\nHydrogen thermal oil heaters are typically deployed in industries requiring precise, indirect process heating such as chemical manufacturing, plastics processing, pharmaceutical production, food processing, and textile manufacturing where stable temperatures and contamination-free heat transfer are essential requirements.",

This technology enables true circular economy approaches for polyester materials by breaking down post-consumer or post-industrial PET waste into its monomer form and then rebuilding the polymer chains through controlled polymerization reactions. The process serves as a chemical recycling pathway that produces polymer indistinguishable from petroleum-based virgin material.\n\nThe technology operates by feeding recycled BHET monomers into a reactor system where they undergo polycondensation reactions under carefully controlled temperature and vacuum conditions. The process requires 0.709 GJ of electricity to power reactor systems, vacuum pumps, and control equipment, while 2.28 GJ of hot oil provides the thermal energy necessary to maintain optimal reaction temperatures, typically between 270-290°C. As polymerization progresses, the molecular chains grow longer through the elimination of ethylene glycol byproduct, ultimately producing high-molecular-weight PET polymer suitable for demanding applications. For every 1.32 tonnes of recycled BHET input, the system generates approximately 1 tonne of recycled PET resin.\n\nThis chemical recycling approach offers significant environmental advantages over virgin PET production from petroleum feedstocks, as it diverts plastic waste from landfills and incineration while reducing dependence on fossil resources. The technology is particularly valuable for producing food-grade PET for beverage bottles, packaging films, and textile fibers where regulatory requirements demand high purity levels.

The primary purpose is to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, which contribute to acid rain and pose significant environmental and health risks. FGD systems are typically installed downstream of combustion sources such as boilers, furnaces, and power generation facilities.\n\nThe technology works by processing flue gas through a desulfurization system where sulfur compounds are chemically or physically separated from the gas stream. For every tonne of incoming flue gas, the system produces approximately 0.98 tonnes of cleaned (desulfurized) flue gas along with 0.02 tonnes of elemental sulfur and wet sulfur as byproducts. The sulfur removal process typically involves chemical absorption, where the H2S reacts with sorbents or catalysts to form recoverable sulfur compounds that can be extracted as wet sulfur or elemental sulfur.\n\nThe environmental benefits of FGD are substantial, as it prevents sulfur dioxide from being released into the atmosphere, thereby reducing acid rain formation, improving air quality, and protecting ecosystems. The recovered sulfur represents an additional benefit, as it can be sold as a commodity for use in sulfuric acid production, fertilizer manufacturing, and various industrial applications. This byproduct recovery can partially offset the operational costs of the desulfurization system while eliminating the need for sulfur disposal.\n\nFGD systems are widely deployed in power generation plants, petroleum refineries, natural gas processing facilities, pulp and paper mills, and any industrial operation where sulfur-containing fuels are burned or sulfur compounds are released during processing.

    "short_description": "Capture and compression of high-concentration CO2 streams (>95%vol) based on inherent separation in ",
    "laymans_description": "Add-on CO2 capture and compression technology takes concentrated carbon dioxide emissions—typically 95% pure or higher—that are already separated during industrial processes like ethanol production, ammonia manufacturing, or natural gas processing, and compresses this CO2 into a liquid form so it can be efficiently transported via pipelines, ships, or trucks to storage sites or facilities that can use it.",
    "detailed_description": "Add-on CO2 capture and compression technology is designed for industrial processes that inherently produce high-purity carbon dioxide streams exceeding 95% concentration by volume, requiring only compression and liquefaction rather than separation processes. This system compresses the already-separated CO2 to approximately 110 bar pressure for transportation via truck or ship, achieving a 100% capture rate of the available CO2 stream. The technology is specifically applicable to processes where CO2 separation occurs naturally as part of the industrial operation, such as ammonia production, bioethanol fermentation, or hydrogen manufacturing from steam methane reforming with inherent CO2 separation.\n\nThe system operates using electricity as its sole energy input, consuming 0.583 TJ to power the compression and liquefaction equipment. The compression process works by mechanically increasing the pressure of the high-purity CO2 gas stream to approximately 110 bar, simultaneously cooling it to achieve a liquid state suitable for transport and storage. The output is liquefied carbon dioxide ready for loading into specialized transport vessels or containers.\n\nThis technology provides significant environmental benefits by capturing CO2 that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere from industrial point sources, enabling carbon sequestration or utilization in other applications. The high concentration of the input stream makes this approach highly energy-efficient compared to capture technologies that must separate CO2 from dilute gas mixtures. Industries commonly applying this technology include fertilizer manufacturing plants, bioethanol refineries, natural gas processing facilities, and other chemical production operations where pure CO2 is a natural byproduct of the core industrial process.",
